# Econometrics-Data-Assignment

This research project aimed to investigate the correlation between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater level in India. The study utilized district-level data on groundwater level, economic output (SDP), and income inequality (Gini index) to explore the relationship between these variables. The analysis was guided by the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory, which suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and environmental quality.

Inititally

- The data is analyzed through regression models and statistical analysis. Initial findings indicate a negligible impact of economic output on groundwater level. However, when income inequality is considered, a significant positive relationship with groundwater level emerges.

- Visual representations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and residual plots are used to enhance the understanding of the data and model fit.

- Our preliminary findings suggest a positive relationship between income inequality (measured by the Gini index) and groundwater level. The insights generated from this study aim to provide valuable guidance to policymakers for promoting sustainable development in India.

## Findings:

#### Economic Output (SDP):
The coefficient for SDP was negative, indicating a potential inverse relationship with groundwater level. However, the high standard error and lack of statistical significance at the 0.1 level prevented us from obtaining a clear relationship. Therefore, we did not observe the expected Environmental Kuznets Curve for groundwater level.

#### Income Inequality (Gini Index):
The coefficient for the Gini index was positive and statistically significant, suggesting that areas with higher income inequality tend to have higher groundwater levels. This finding implies that unequal wealth distribution may contribute to increased exploitation of groundwater resources.

#### Rainfall:
The coefficient for log(Rainfall) was negative and statistically significant. This aligns with expectations, as regions with higher rainfall levels tend to have better groundwater levels. The result implies that groundwater levels are influenced by climatic factors, with higher rainfall supporting replenishment.

#### Electoral Turnout:
The coefficient for Turnout was negative, indicating that regions with higher electoral turnout may have more motivated and environmentally aware individuals. However, this variable was not statistically significant, and thus we cannot confidently claim this relationship.

#### Net Sown Land Area:
The coefficient for Net.sown.land.area was positive and statistically significant. This suggests that an increase in the area of land under cultivation is associated with a depletion of groundwater levels. This finding aligns with expectations, as agriculture is a water-intensive activity.

#### State Group Analysis:
Coefficients for state group dummy variables showed significant positive effects for the north, east, south, and northeast regions compared to the central states. This suggests that these regions tend to have higher groundwater levels. However, the coefficient for the west group was not statistically significant.

#### Gender Equality (GPHS.ST):
The coefficient for GPHS.ST was negative, indicating that areas with higher gender equality may have higher groundwater levels. However, this variable was not statistically significant, and further investigation is required.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this research project revealed mixed findings regarding the correlation between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater level in India. While income inequality (Gini index) exhibited a positive relationship with groundwater levels, the expected Environmental Kuznets Curve was not observed for economic output (SDP). Other factors such as rainfall, agricultural land use, and regional differences were found to influence groundwater levels to varying degrees.

It is important to note that lower groundwater levels generally indicate better environmental quality. However, further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater sustainability in India. The insights from this study can inform policymakers and stakeholders in formulating strategies to promote sustainable development and effective groundwater management practices.
