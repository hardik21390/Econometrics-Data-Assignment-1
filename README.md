# Econometrics-Data-Assignment


This repository contains the code for an assignment on analyzing the relationship between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater level in India. The goal of this assignment is to explore the environmental Kuznets curve and its relationship with groundwater level.

The assignment tasks are as follows:

    1.Choose groundwater level as the environmental quality measure.
    2.Transform the original dataset into a district-year level dataset that includes a unique district-year ID for each row in the sample.
    3.Merge the district-year level groundwater level data with the corresponding state-year wise economic output data (SDP) provided by the Reserve Bank of India.
    4.Merge the dataset with the district-level Gini index from the paper by Mohanty et al. (2016).
    5.Prepare detailed summary statistics for all variables and check for outliers.
    6.Estimate a regression model for groundwater level and summarize the results in a table.
    7.Visualize the model residuals on a plot and interpret the relationship between groundwater level, SDP, and residuals.
    8.Plot a histogram of the residuals and verify that the sum of the residuals equals zero.
    9.Estimate a second regression model that includes the Gini index and summarize the results in a table and interpret.
