# Econometrics-Data-Assignment


This repository contains the code for an assignment on analyzing the relationship between economic growth, income inequality, and groundwater level in India. The goal of this assignment is to explore the environmental Kuznets curve and its relationship with groundwater level.

In the First Part 

    The data is analyzed through regression models and statistical analysis. Initial findings indicate a negligible impact of economic output on groundwater level. However, when income inequality is considered, a     significant positive relationship with groundwater level emerges.

    Visual representations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and residual plots are used to enhance the understanding of the data and model fit.

    Our preliminary findings suggest a positive relationship between income inequality (measured by the Gini index) and groundwater level. The insights generated from this study aim to provide valuable guidance to policymakers for promoting sustainable development in India.

Please refer to the assignment document for more detailed instructions and resources.
Please refer to the final PPT for the insights.
